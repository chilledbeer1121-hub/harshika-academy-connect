# Harshika Academy,

Single-page marketing site for Harshika Academy, a coaching institute in
Bhairunda, Madhya Pradesh, run by Mohit Sarathe. One scroll, no internal routing — every nav link
is an anchor to a section on the same page.

The page has one job: convince a parent to tap WhatsApp or call. The audience is
parents and school students on mid-range Android phones over 4G, so it is built
to stay fast and legible on a small screen.

## Running it

Requires Node 20+. The repo uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) (`bun.lock`), but npm
works fine.

```bash
bun install && bun run dev
```

| Command           | What it does                      |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `bun run dev`     | Dev server with HMR               |
| `bun run build`   | Production build into `.output/`  |
| `bun run preview` | Currently broken — see note below |
| `bun run lint`    | ESLint + Prettier                 |
| `bun run format`  | Rewrite files with Prettier       |

`bun run preview` does not work in this template: the build targets Cloudflare
Workers and emits to `.output/`, while Vite's preview server looks for
`dist/server/server.js`. Use `bun run dev` locally, or deploy the build with
`npx nitro deploy --prebuilt`.

Typecheck with `npx tsc --noEmit`. The TypeScript config is strict, including
`noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`.

## Editing the site

**Everything the academy needs to change lives in
[`src/data/content.ts`](src/data/content.ts)** — phone number, WhatsApp link,
address, timings, stats, courses and batches, faculty, results, gallery photos,
testimonials and FAQs. They are typed exports, so a wrong shape fails the build
rather than silently breaking a section.

Swapping a photo means replacing a URL in that file. Every image sits in a
fixed aspect-ratio box, so a replacement of any dimensions will not shift the
layout.

## Theme

The site is warm off-white with gold accents by default, plus a **dark mode**
(gold on near-black) behind the header switch.

Section components are one file each, in `src/components/academy/`.

## Design system

**Light is the default; dark is opt-in.** The switch lives in the header (and in
the mobile menu), the choice is remembered in `localStorage`, and an inline
script in `<head>` stamps it before first paint so there is no flash of the
wrong theme on reload. The light palette is keyed on
`:root:not([data-theme="dark"])`, so a missing attribute still lands on light.

| Token           | Light (default) | Dark      | Use                                |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `--page`        | `#FCFAF6`       | `#0B0E14` | Page background                    |
| `--panel`       | `#F4EFE4`       | `#141926` | Alternating sections, cards        |
| `--heading`     | `#12151C`       | `#FFFFFF` | Headlines                          |
| `--body`        | `#4A5060`       | `#B9BFCC` | Body text                          |
| `--gold`        | `#8A6314`       | `#E3B23C` | Accent **text**, borders, tints    |
| `--gold-bright` | `#7D5810`       | `#F7DC8A` | Secondary accent text, hover       |
| `--gold-deep`   | `#5E410B`       | `#A97C1E` | Deep accent                        |
| `--gold-fill`   | `#E3B23C`       | `#E3B23C` | Solid button fill — bright in both |
| `--on-gold`     | `#0B0E14`       | `#0B0E14` | Text on a gold fill — dark in both |
| `--foil-a/b/c`  | dark-gold ramp  | gold ramp | `gold-foil` gradient stops only    |

Three splits make the light mode work, and they are easy to undo by accident:

- **`--gold` is the readable accent, `--gold-fill` is the button.** Brand gold on
  white is 1.9:1, so accent _text_ darkens to `#8A6314` (5.2:1) while button
  fills stay bright with near-black `--on-gold` on top (9.8:1).
- **`--on-gold` never flips.** It sits on a gold fill in both modes.
- **`--foil-*` is separate from `--gold-bright`** so the foil gradient can be
  retuned for light without dragging readable text colour with it. The foil is
  only ever used on large display headings, where the 3:1 large-text bar applies.

Display type is Anton in all caps; body is Plus Jakarta Sans at 1.65 line
height; eyebrows are Inter 600, uppercase, `0.18em` tracking.

## Scroll motion

The Courses section is a deck of `position: sticky` cards that stack as you
scroll — pure CSS, no JavaScript. Reveals are CSS scroll-driven animations
(`animation-timeline: view()`) where the browser supports them, with the
original JS fallback elsewhere. Wheel scrolling is smoothed with Lenis; window
scrolls from code go through `scrollWindowTo()` so the two never fight. All of
it is off under `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Conventions

- **No fees, prices or payment information anywhere on the page.** Batch timings
  and admission details go through WhatsApp.
- Accessibility: semantic sections with ids matching the nav, visible focus
  rings, alt text on every image, ARIA labels on icon-only buttons, and a
  keyboard-operable accordion, tab set and gallery lightbox.
- Motion: fade-and-rise on scroll, 16px over 500ms, staggered. Under
  `prefers-reduced-motion` everything lands on its final state instantly.
- Responsive from 360px to 1920px with no horizontal scroll.
- The enquiry form is client-side only — it validates and confirms inline. There
  is no backend; wire a real endpoint into `onSubmit` in
  `src/components/academy/Contact.tsx` when one exists.
